The sun rises over the horizon,
Painting the sky in hues of orange and pink.Painting the sky in hues of orange and pink.Painting the sky in hues of orange and pink.Painting the sky in hues of orange and pink.
Birds sing their morning chorus,Birds sing their morning chorus,Birds sing their morning chorus,Birds sing their morning chorus,
As the world awakens from its slumber.As the world awakens from its slumber.As the world awakens from its slumber.As the world awakens from its slumber.As the world awakens from its slumber.As the world awakens from its slumber.
The city stirs to life,
With the hustle and bustle of daily routines.
People rush to work,
Lost in their own thoughts and worries.
But amidst the chaos,
There lies a moment of stillness.
A quiet corner of the park,
Where time seems to stand still.
Here, one can find solace,
Amidst the greenery and tranquility.
The gentle rustle of leaves,
The soft chirping of crickets.
It's a place to escape,
From the noise and clamor of the city.
A sanctuary for the soul,
Where one can find peace.
As the day unfolds,
The park comes alive.
Children play tag,
Couples stroll hand in hand.
Families gather for picnics,
Sharing laughter and love.
And in the midst of it all,
There's a sense of unity.
A shared appreciation,
For the beauty of nature.
As the sun sets,
Casting long shadows across the grass.
The park grows quiet once more,
A serene oasis in the heart of the city.
And as night falls,
And the stars twinkle overhead.
There's a sense of gratitude,
For the simple moments of joy.
For in this little corner of the world,
Amidst the chaos of life.
There is beauty to be found,
In the everyday moments.
And so we cherish,
The gift of the park.
A haven of peace,
In a busy world.
